# Sneaky Tip Calculator
 
When I'm out with friends, we struggle to discuss tip with the waiters hovering around us. We worry if we're giving too little. Or we make a bunch of calculations and get lost in all of the decimal values. I've made this calculator with those stuggles in mind.

## Calculate tip or find out how much percent an amount would be
For when you have a certain tip amount in mind, but worry that the percentage is too low. Fill in Subtotal and Tip, and this will show you how much percent that amount is relative to the subtotal.

## Discretely figure out how much you're going to tip
Rather than tapping away at your calculator app and trying to remember, calculate once and see it populate the table. Then see a list of your calculations for easy comparison.

Delete rows that aren't for consideration, or refill the Subtotal with a tap so you don't have to type it again.

## Highlight rows with a double-tap
Easily distinguish which tip you want to go with without discussing out loud.
